# Wizard

## Access the box

You can access the box graphic interface through [NoVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html).

To login use *live* user and *live* password.

You are now in the box.

## Start the wizard

You will need to start the installer wizard. It will guide you through the configuration of the box.

### Setup language and timezone

Setup the language and the timezone of your preference. It will also start ZeroNet with the choosen language if available.

### Setup the keyboard

The choice of the keyboard is important in case you want to plug a keyboard and a screen to directly access the box like a computer (without VNC).

### Access configuration

In the last part of the wizard, you can modify the name of your user and the password. You can also rename the machine, we recommend keeping **zerobox** if you have several boxes you ca pick a new name (e.g zerobox2).
